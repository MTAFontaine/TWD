        <h1>Daryll "Dogman" Biker dude</h1>
        <img src="../img/ddog.jpg" alt="Daryll from the walking dead in a prisoner outfit, sitting down in his dark cell, being handed a sandwich made from dog food">
        <p>It could be easy to mistake this being with an average human. Believe me not, Daryll is an actual dog. Now I dont mean this in a insulting way. Let me explain.</p>
        <ul><strong><em>Everything</em> in his personallity will remind you of a dog.</strong>
        <li>Doesnt care to take a bath (in 10 years)</li>
        <li>Does bark if provoked</li>
        <li>Is loyal to one particular human</li>
        <li>Even in its wild phase, he will always come back home eventually</li></ul>
        <ol><strong>Knowing all of this, here's my plan to put doggo to bed</strong>
        <li>Find a bone</li>
        <li>Fake throw said bone at Dogman</li>
        <li>Him not seeing the bone fly into the air as usual, and unbable to go fetch, he'll turn back to me wondering where the bone at</li>
        <li>Use said bone to pummel its snout to the ground</li></ol>
