        <h1>Uncomfortably intense look guy</h1>
        <img src="../img/rickcries.avif" alt="Close up pic of Rick's face from the walking dead. His blue eyes are injected with blood and filled with tears. We can guess trees from the blurry background">
        <p>Rick "weird eyes" Grimmes is an ex-cop that lost about everything, wife, kid, self respect, honor. Even though he must have some kinf of experience in beatings from his job, lets not forget that Big Eyes Rick is above elser a big crybaby.</p>
        <ul><strong>"Uncomfortably intense look guy" Strength & Weaknesses:</strong></ul>
        <li>Is taller</li>
        <li>Did kill someone with his teeth</li>
        <li>Always wants to be the good guy</li>
        <li>Cries like a lil bitch</li>
        <ol> <strong>My plan for an easy win :</strong></ol>
        <li>Unbury his sons body</li>
        <li>Cut and Wear his face as a mask</li>
        <li>Make a spooky ghost dance </li>
        <p>At this point he should be crying, <em>because that's what rick does</em>. Unable to see, i reckon a sinlge blow under the chin should suffice.</p>
