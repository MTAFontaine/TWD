        <h1>"Dont Care" Caroll</h1>
        <img src="../img/caroll.webp" alt="face shot of Caroll from TWD, she has dryed blood stains on her face, prolly not hers; and she carries a rifle on her back. The background, while clearly outside, is blurry.">
        <p>Ok this one is a toughie. "Don't Care" Caroll used to be a beaten housewife, smiling and making cookies for her kid. Since then, she kinda changed.</p>
        <p>After brutally destroying her husband body with a pickaxe, she will live to have a dozen children that will, one by one, die under her protection.The first three could be excused, but at point you gotta realize motherhood ain't for you.</p>
        <p>Some say that Caroll would rather personnally burn every kid on earth before going to therapy. <em>They are right.</em></p>
    <ul>Here's more about Crazy Caroll:
    <li>Knows how to shoot with anything that shoots</li>
    <li>Always hides a knife somewhere</li>
    <li>Uses her petite form to lure opponent into not considering her as a danger</li>
    <li>If the only solution to a problem is killing, she will kill.</li>
    <li> For any other kind of problem, she <em>will</em> kill, even though a better solution has been found.</li></ul>
    <ol>Concentrating this intel, here's the easiest plan to take out Cray-cray-Caroll:
        <li>Hide</li>
        <li>Try to not make noises. (Even if it hasn't been said by the screenwriters, i'm pretty sure she has an acute hearing like of an owl.)</li>
        <li>Don't Focus on my sphincter giving up under the pressure</li>
        <li>ignore the lingering smell of fear</li>
        <li>At this point she would hear my poop running down my leg</li>
        <li>Try to make a run for it, uncontrollably waving my arms around hoping to get eaten my a zombie before caroll catches up with me.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As seen above, Caroll is a remarkable opponent, and a woman, which are two <em>valid</em> reasons to refuse a fight with her.</p>
